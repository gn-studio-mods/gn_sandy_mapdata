# gn_sandy_mapdata
All G&N's and other designer compatibility in Sandy Shores

  **How do I find my compatibility?**
  
  Each file contains information on its compatibility
  
  Example:
  
  -> GN_clinic+GN_burgershot+GN_Sheriff_Dept + Motel
  
      = G&N's Sandy Shores Clinic Center
      = G&N's Sandy Shores BurgerShot
      = G&N's Sandy Shores Sheriff Department
      = G&N's Sandy Shores Motel

  **How to install?**

  1. Delete the **"cfx_gn_sandy_mapdata"** resource you already have in your server.
  
  2. Search for the compatibility that suits you best and add the **"cfx_gn_sandy_mapdata"** resource of this compatibility.

  3. **Be sure to read the readme** for each compatibility. Some files must be deleted, depending on compatibility with other creators.

  **I don't have my compatibility, what can I do?**

  G&N's tries to provide you with as many options as possible. Unfortunately, it's impossible to create every possibility.
  
  That's why we encourage you not to use too many mods from different creators.
  
  G&N's offers and will continue to offer the maximum number of modifications to Sandy Shores with guaranteed compatibility with all G&N's mods.

  If you need other compatibilities, you can make a request in the G&N's Studio Discord support, or post an issue on GitHub.
  
  Each pull request from the community or from other creators will be studied in order to be proposed to all the communities.
